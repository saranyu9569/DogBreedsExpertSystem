# Dog Breed Expert System

This project is an Expert System implemented using Prolog, designed to recommend the most suitable dog breed based on a series of user inputs. The system interacts with the user by asking a series of questions and, based on the answers, suggests the best dog breed that matches their needs. The system is implemented entirely in Prolog and displays the results through the Prolog environment.

## Features

- **Expert System**: Uses Prolog to implement an Expert System that asks questions to the user to determine their needs and suggest a suitable dog breed.
- **Interactive Q&A**: The system interacts with the user by asking questions such as lifestyle preferences, living environment, and activity level.
- **Dog Breed Recommendation**: Based on user input, the system recommends the best breed that fits their specific requirements.
- **Prolog-based Logic**: Uses Prolog's logical reasoning capabilities to evaluate the userâ€™s answers and match them to appropriate dog breeds.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have a Prolog interpreter installed. You can download [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) or any other Prolog implementation.

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breed-expert-system.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd dog-breed-expert-system


Open the Prolog file (e.g., `dog_breed.pl`) in your Prolog interpreter and load it:
?- [dog_breed].

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: After loading the Prolog file, you can start the Expert System by typing the following query:
?- DogBreedsExpertSystem.

2. **Answer Questions**: The system will ask you a series of questions about your preferences
   
3. **Receive Recommendation**: Based on your answers, the system will recommend a dog breed that matches your needs.

4. **Repeat or Exit**: You can exit the program or restart by re-running the recommendation query.

## Technologies Used

- **Prolog**: The main programming language for implementing the Expert System's logic and user interaction.
- **SWI-Prolog** (or any Prolog interpreter): To run and interact with the system.
